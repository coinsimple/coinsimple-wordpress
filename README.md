### Troubleshooting

* This plugin requires PHP 5.4 or higher to function correctly. Contact your webhosting provider or server administrator if you are unsure which version is installed on your web server.
* Ensure a valid SSL certificate is installed on your server. Also ensure your root CA cert is updated. If your CA cert is not current, you will see curl SSL verification errors.

* Check the system error log file (usually the web server error log) for any errors during CoinSimple payment attempts. If you contact CoinSimple support, they will ask to see the log file to help diagnose the problem.
* If all else fails, send an email describing your issue in detail to [support@coinsimple.com](mailto:support@coinsimple.com). In your support request, please provide:

	* WP eCommerce version
	* PHP version
	* Other plugins installed
	* Configuration settings for the CoinSimple plugin
